What is the purpose of the code?

    the purpose of this code is to pass a user input to organize  and print a list of numbers from least to greatest using the bubble sorting algorithm 

What is the name of the sort algorithm used by Walter?

    The name of the sorting algorithm is called Bubble sort

Explain how list 1 will be processed by the program.

List 1 is processed by first recieveing a value passed by the user, this value is then passed through an if statement that begins iterating through the vector array and swapping values in ascending order. 

Explain how list 2 will be processed by the program.

Because List 2 is already in ascending order, the bubble sort iterates through each value with no swaps causing the program to print the list as is.

Explain what happens when you input 1.21?

The program terminates and prompts the user to enter a valid input, list to sort.

Explain what happens when you input two?

The outcome of inputting 2 into the program is that it will print the entire list to the user.

How many functions are used in the code?

2 functions are present in his code, Vector<int> and the Main function.

Run fixme.cpp several times and explain some of the weaknesses of this code. Also elaborate is how these could be fixed.

One weakness of the code is that it stops running once an invalid input is passed through the program, one common fix is to run a while loop that runs the program again to check for a valid input instead of quitting the program outright.
